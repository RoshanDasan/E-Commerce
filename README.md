# E-Commerce
This is my personal e-commerce website designed to gain knowledge about web development. The website was built using Express.js and MongoDB, and I implemented APIs to better understand their functionality.

The website includes fully comprehensible code, and I'm happy to say that anyone can make contributions to it.
